*********************************************************************

A. Stateful Firewall

  Allow all FTP communications for both ACTIVE and PASSIVE modes.
  It blocks any communication except for FTP related traffic.
  When legitimate client try to set FTP communication via 21 port,
  ONOS application direct the ONOS to pass the packet through the
  switch, otherwise to give the flow rule to drop the packet. After
  session creating, application also handle both PASSIVE and ACTIVE
  mode.

  For ACTIVE mode,

  before the client creates the data connection, it notifies the server
  the port that will be used later. The control message always contains
  'PORT' keyword that can be parsed by ONOS application as well server
  does. After getting port number, firewall also makes the flow rule
  that directs the switch to allow the packet passing through correspond
  port. It will give drop rule except control path (port 21) and data
  path (port selected) definitely.

  For PASSIVE mode,

  before the client creates the data connection, the server notifies
  the port that will be used later. The control message wlays contains
  'Entering passive mode' keyword that can be parsed by ONOS application
  as well server does. After getting port number, firewall also makes the
  flow rule that directs the switch to allow the packet passing through
  correspond port. It will give drop rule except control path (port 21)
  and data path (port selected) definitely.

B. Redirection

  TCP session destinating h2 server, will be redirected to h3.
  For instance, h1 tries to send packets to h2, the packets would be
  automatically redirected to h3.
  It uses FLOW_MOD to control the flow. It examines the IP DST and IP SRC
  to check redirection is needed and if it needs, it will give modified
  flow rules to redirect the packet. It could be done by set the treatment
  in ONOS terms. Surely, when the reply packet is turned back, the source
  IP address is changed from h3 to h2 automatically by modifying the flow
  rules.

C. Monitoring

  Detect the flow rule whose byte per second is greater than 10Mbytes/s
  Print the flow rule, the sender of the flow rule, and the bytes sended
  on ONOS log. It uses FLOW_STATISTICS implemented naturally. Because flow
  entry stores the bytes of the flowed packet, the monitoring thread checks
  the bytes every one second.
